</p>

There are 3 classes in interface role. Your application will call methods of the interfaces. The CortexClient will build request message and communicate with Emotiv CortexService. The others are helper classes. 

**DataStreamManager**: Reponsible for managing data streams subscribing from connecting to Emotiv CortexService to data subscribing data.

**RecordManager**: Reponsible for managing and handling records and markers.

**BCITraining**: Reponsible for brainâ€“computer interface (BCI) training included mental command and facial expression.

**Authorizer**: Reponsible for authorizing process and manage cortex token.

**SessionHandler**: Reponsible for handling sessions and records.

**HeadsetFinder**: Reponsible for finding headsets.

**DataStreamProcess**: Process data stream scribing. 

**CortexClient**: Create a websocket client, build request message to work with Emotiv CortexService.

In addition, the plugin create data buffers to keep data return from Cortex. You can change windows size and step size for reading data from the buffers.

## How to use
Please follow the below steps:
1. Setup App configuration: clientId, clientSecret for indentifying Application and other informations such as appName, appVersion to make temp folder.
2. Start authorizing procedure: Start connecting Emotiv Cortex then authorize to get token for working with Cortex. After authorizing successfully, the Plugin will find headsets automatically.
3. Start Data Stream: Create and activate a session with given headset and start subscribe given data streams.
4. You can subscribe or unsubscribe more data streams and do other tasks such as record and training.

```
// setup App configuration
DataStreamManager.Instance.SetAppConfig("clientId_Of_App", "clientId_Of_App", "1.0.0", "UnityApp");
// start connect and authorize
DataStreamManager.Instance.StartAuthorize();

// ... 
// authorize successfully then find headsets

// creating session and subscribe data
List<string> dataStreamList = new List<string>(){DataStreamName.DevInfos};
DataStreamManager.Instance.StartDataStream(dataStreamList, "headsetId);

// You also can suscribe more data
DataStreamManager.Instance.SubscribeMoreData(new List<string>(){DataStreamName.EEG, DataStreamName.Motion});

// Or unsubscribe data
DataStreamManager.Instance.UnSubscribeData(new List<string>(){DataStreamName.EEG, DataStreamName.Motion});

// Or start a record or training data
RecordManager.Instance.StartRecord("record title", "record description")

```
