// ... 
// authorize successfully then find headsets

// creating session and subscribe data
List<string> dataStreamList = new List<string>(){DataStreamName.DevInfos};
DataStreamManager.Instance.StartDataStream(dataStreamList, "headsetId);

// You also can suscribe more data
DataStreamManager.Instance.SubscribeMoreData(new List<string>(){DataStreamName.EEG, DataStreamName.Motion});

// Or unsubscribe data
DataStreamManager.Instance.UnSubscribeData(new List<string>(){DataStreamName.EEG, DataStreamName.Motion});
